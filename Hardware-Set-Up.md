## Hardware-Set-Up

### 1.Putting the Pi together **Skip to 2.7 if you do not have Pi case
1.1 If you have the optional Pi case, take the cover lid off of the fan power supply pins

1.3 Connect the fan to it's power supply; Don't brute force it, direction does matter!

1.4 Slide the Pi into the case port side in first and lightly press down until it is in
**Note** The pi may not look like it's in all the way or may look misalgined that it fine

1.5 Put the case cover on and screw it in. If you want too include the Micro SD card cover you can, but I reccommend doing that after you finish all the inital set up steps. Once screwed in the components should settle into  place and now have a fully assembled Pi
