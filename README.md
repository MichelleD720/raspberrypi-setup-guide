## Purpose
This article outlines how to set up a Raspberry Pi using a headless method (no monitor), connect it to Wi-Fi, and access it from a desktop computer via SSH. It also documents real obstacles I faced during the setup process—such as networking issues and SD card troubleshooting—to help others avoid the same pitfalls.
