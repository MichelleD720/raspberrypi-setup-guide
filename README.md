## Purpose
This article outlines how to set up a Raspberry Pi using a headless method (no monitor), connect it to Wi-Fi, and access it from a desktop computer via SSH. It also documents real obstacles I faced during the setup process—such as networking issues and SD card troubleshooting—to help others avoid the same pitfalls.

## Obstacles 
- Couldn’t find the fan’s connection port. **Skip to 1.1**
- Ports misaligned, making it hard to fit the Pi into the case. **Skip to 1.4**  
- No display output, so switched to headless setup.  
- Trouble connecting to Wi-Fi and locating IP/MAC addresses. **Skip to 3.8**
#### Note 
I will explain how I fixed the display output to monitor issue and also I am a windows user. 

## Prerequisite
- Raspberry Pi board  
- MicroSD card (8GB+ recommended)  
- Micro SD card reader  
- Power supply for the Pi  
- Computer with internet access
- Ethernet cable
- Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password  
- Raspberry Pi OS image ([https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/))
### Optional
  -HDMI to micro HDMI for monitor
  -Monitor
  -Keyboard
  -Mouse
  -Pi case
#### Note 
I purchased the Vilros "WAVE" Raspberry Pi 5 Compatible Aluminum Alloy Active + Passive Cooling Case, it's just okay.
